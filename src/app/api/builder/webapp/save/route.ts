/* Where a finished page is put away.
 *
 * The orchestrator generates the page — it can, because an n8n node has no
 * sixty-second ceiling and a Vercel function does — and then posts it here. So
 * this route does no model work at all: it validates, stores, points the
 * project at its new preview, and returns. It runs in well under a second,
 * which is the point.
 *
 * The chat was answered long before this: the workflow replies "Building" as
 * soon as the prompt is classified, and the workspace watches the project row
 * for the preview this writes. Nobody is waiting on this request.
 *
 * Who may call it: n8n, carrying a signature this app made in /api/build over
 * the three ids it had already checked ownership of. Without it, anyone who
 * learned the URL could put their own HTML on someone else's preview — which,
 * since that HTML is then served to its owner, is the one thing here worth
 * attacking. See src/lib/build-signature.ts. */
